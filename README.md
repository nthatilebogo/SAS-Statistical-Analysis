# SAS-Statistical-Analysis
Welcome to the SAS Statistical Analysis Repository, where you'll find a compilation of projects completed during my studies at the University of Pretoria. This repository showcases practical applications of statistical analysis and data manipulation using the SAS programming language.

Key Features:

Statistical Problem Solving: Explore the art of statistical problem-solving, delving into topics like causality, experimental and observational data analysis, and probability theory. These concepts provide the foundation for your SAS-based statistical endeavors.

Probability and Random Variables: Develop a deep understanding of probability theory, including multivariate random variables and the handling of both discrete and continuous probability distributions. Gain valuable insights into the stochastic representations of real-world phenomena.

Statistical Measures and Analysis: Learn how to calculate and interpret measures of association, expected values, and conditional expectations using SAS. Apply these techniques to extract meaningful insights from your data.

Simulation Techniques: Discover powerful simulation techniques within SAS, allowing you to model complex scenarios and make informed decisions based on statistical simulations.

Mathematical Fundamentals: Strengthen your grasp of mathematical concepts that underpin statistical analysis, providing a solid theoretical foundation for your SAS-based projects.
